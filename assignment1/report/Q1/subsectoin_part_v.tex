\subsection{Part v: Box Plot for Purchased Goods, Aircraft Ownership, and Daily Utilization}
Box plots are developed for the variables ``Purchased Goods", ``Aircraft Ownership", and ``Daily Utilization per Aircraft" to visualize their spread and identify any outliers. At first categories of each of the variables are defined.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 11, lastline = 14]{../Q1_v.R}

Data for each variable was loaded using the \textit{get\_category\_data} function.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 31, lastline = 39]{../Q1_v.R}

Box plot for each variable was drawn using the following functions.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 41, lastline = 71]{../Q1_v.R}
