\subsection{Part II: Determination and Interpretation of R Squared }

First the rows of all data are defined
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=21, lastline=27]{../Q2_ii.R}

Then data for each fleet categories are extracted using the following function
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=10, lastline=18]{../Q2_ii.R}

The r squared value is calculated using the following function
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=45, lastline=54]{../Q2_ii.R}

\subsubsection{Concise Interpretation of R-Squared Values}

The R-squared values reflect the extent to which various independent variables explain the variance in ``Salaries and Wages'':

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pilot Training Data:}
          Strong explanatory power, particularly for widebodies (0.7685), indicating that training data accounts for approximately 77\% of the variance in salaries and wages. The total fleet R-squared is also significant at 0.6107.

    \item \textbf{Benefits and Payroll Taxes:}
          Very low explanatory power, with small narrowbodies at 0.2449 and large narrowbodies at only 0.0582, suggesting minimal influence on salaries. The total fleet R-squared (0.1341) reinforces this finding.

    \item \textbf{Per Diem/Personnel:}
          Moderate explanatory power for small narrowbodies (0.4479) and large narrowbodies (0.3492), but limited impact for widebodies (0.0623) and overall (0.3083).

    \item \textbf{Maintenance:}
          Generally low across all categories, particularly for widebodies (0.0458), indicating minimal effect on salaries, with a total fleet R-squared of 0.0629.

    \item \textbf{Aircraft Ownership:}
          Moderate influence, especially for small narrowbodies (0.4229). R-squared values for large narrowbodies (0.2501) and widebodies (0.1528) are lower, with a total fleet R-squared of 0.1732.
