\section{Question 1}
The provided file contains data on small narrowbodies, large narrowbodies, widebodies and total feelt. Each fleet
type was analyzed individually. All data bounded by rectable b2 to w158 was loaded using the following code:
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 6, lastline = 8]{../Q1_i_iii.R}

After that salary wages of small narrowbodies, large narrowbodies, widebodies and total fleet was extracted using the following code. where \textit{get\_data\_by\_row} was used to load data from the desired row.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 10, lastline = 19]{../Q1_i_iii.R}

\subsection{Part v: Box Plot for Purchased Goods, Aircraft Ownership, and Daily Utilization}
Box plots are developed for the variables "Purchased Goods", "Aircraft Ownership", and "Daily Utilization per Aircraft" to visualize their spread and identify any outliers.

\subsection{Part vi: Interpretation of the Plots}
The histogram for "Grouped Salaries" shows a slightly skewed distribution, with most employees concentrated around the median salary. The box plots show the spread of each variable, with "Purchased Goods" exhibiting a significant amount of variability and potential outliers. The "Load Factor" bar diagram shows a consistent pattern of utilization, while the "Maintenance" pie chart provides insight into the relative maintenance cost distribution.

\section*{Conclusion}
This report has provided a detailed statistical analysis of the United Airlines Aircraft Operating Statistics dataset. We have computed descriptive statistics, created frequency distributions, and visualized the data using various plots, each contributing valuable insights into the dataset.
