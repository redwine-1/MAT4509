\section{Question 1}
The provided file contains data on small narrowbodies, large narrowbodies, widebodies and total feelt. Each fleet
type was analyzed individually. All data bounded by rectangle b2 to w158 was loaded using the following code:
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 6, lastline = 8]{../Q1_i_iii.R}

After that salary wages of small narrowbodies, large narrowbodies, widebodies and total fleet was extracted using the following code. where \textit{get\_data\_by\_row} was used to load data from the desired row.
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline = 10, lastline = 19]{../Q1_i_iii.R}

\section*{Conclusion}
This report has provided a detailed statistical analysis of the United Airlines Aircraft Operating Statistics dataset. To create this report I have computed measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, created frequency distributions, and visualized the data using various plots, each contributing valuable insights into the dataset.
