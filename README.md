# Probability & Statistics ( MAT 4509 )

This repository contains all the course related codes of probability and statistics (assigment, project, practice etc) i took during my 5th semester. 

## Rationale of the Course:
Engineering students always require knowledge of probability and statistical to investigate the feasibility of engineering equipment. To provide the knowledge of probability and statistics this course is designed for engineering students.
## Course Objectives:
1. Teach common statistical techniques which are useful for engineering students.
2. Disseminate knowledge to display, summarize and analyse numerical data.
3. Explain fundamental ideas of probability and probability distributions.
4. Clarify how to test a hypothesis for large and small sample.
5. Discuss how statistical techniques and probability are used in statistical inference.

## Course Outcomes (CO):
1. Identify statistical techniques for summarizing and analysing data.
2. Calculate statistics and parameters such as mean, median from data sets.
3. Apply statistics and parameters for social and business decision.
4. Analyse engineering problems in statistical context
